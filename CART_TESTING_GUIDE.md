# 🛒 Cart Testing Guide

## Why the Cart is Empty

The cart showing "Shopping Cart (0)" and "Your cart is empty" is **correct behavior** when no items have been added to it yet. This is not an error - it's working as intended!

## How to Test the Cart Functionality

### Step 1: Open the Application
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Make sure you're logged in (use demo credentials if needed)

### Step 2: Go to Products Page
1. Click on "Products" in the navigation menu
2. You should see a grid of available products with "Add to Cart" buttons

### Step 3: Add Items to Cart
1. Find any product you like
2. Click the "Add to Cart" button
3. You should see:
   - A success toast notification saying "{Product Name} added to cart"
   - The cart icon in the header should show a number (e.g., cart icon with "1")

### Step 4: View Cart
1. Click the cart icon in the header
2. The cart sidebar should open showing:
   - Your added items
   - Quantity controls (+ and - buttons)
   - Price calculations
   - "Proceed to Checkout" button

### Step 5: Test Cart Features
1. **Add more quantities**: Click the "+" button to increase quantity
2. **Remove quantities**: Click the "-" button to decrease quantity
3. **Remove items**: Click the trash/delete icon to remove items completely
4. **Checkout**: Click "Proceed to Checkout" to go to the checkout page

## Expected Cart Behavior

### Empty Cart (Current State)
```
Shopping Cart (0)
🛒 [Empty cart icon]
Your cart is empty
[Start Shopping] button
```

### Cart with Items
```
Shopping Cart (2)  // Number shows total items
📱 Product 1 - $39.99  [- 1 +] [🗑️]
💻 Product 2 - $59.99  [- 1 +] [🗑️]

Subtotal: $99.98
Tax: $8.00
Shipping: Free
Total: $107.98

[Proceed to Checkout]
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Products Don't Load
1. Check that backend server is running on port 5000
2. Check browser console for error messages
3. Try refreshing the page

### If Add to Cart Doesn't Work
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify the product has stock (not "Out of Stock")

### If Cart Items Don't Persist
- Items are automatically saved to localStorage
- They should persist between browser sessions
- Clear browser storage if you want to reset
